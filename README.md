# SemLa: A Visual Analysis System for Fine-grained Text Classification

This repository contains the source code for the demonstration of the visual analytics system SemLa (Semantic Landscape).

SemLa is a tool for analyzing fine-grained text classification models, which is particularly motivated by the special challenges posed by the natural language processing task of intent recognition.
