# Semantic Landscape Visualization for Intent Recognition

This repository contains the source code for the demonstration of the visual analytics system SemLa (Semantic Landscape).

SemLa is a tool for analyzing text classification models, which is particularly motivated by the special challenges posed by the natural language processing task of intent recognition.

Our demo is available at [https://munkhtulgab.github.io/SemLa/](https://munkhtulgab.github.io/SemLa/).
